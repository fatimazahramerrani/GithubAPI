#   Consume Github API using reactJs-HOOKS

git_commit is an application that lists the repositories of github's users.
it is an application that allows us to search any githb's user and access some of his informations like: avatar, location, message(bio), hash and parent hash.
we can also access to the repository and get informations


we used :
-an IDE: Visual Studio Code.
-bootstrap and semantic likes frameworks; bootstrap for 'table and button search' and semantic for 'search bar'.
-React hooks and modals for react.

 
we used 3 components:
Profile.js   
DisplayTablle.js
MOdalProfile.js; to retrieve user information by clicking on the avatar but unfortunately it does not work.
